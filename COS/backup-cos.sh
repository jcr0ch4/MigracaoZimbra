# The result is a file/s for each COS, and the users within this specific COS
# Note: If there are no custom created COS, there will be no users listed in the default and default_external files. That 
# means all users are in the "default" COS.
# Since the default and the default_external files will contain no users, their respective files are deleted at 
# the end. Zimbra only detect users that are not in the default COS. Thus, every non detected user is in the default COS.
